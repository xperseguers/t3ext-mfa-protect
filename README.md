# MFA Protect

This extension lets you force the use of a recent MFA before rendering a content
element.

This may be used together with standard access restrictions in TYPO3 such as
being part of one or more Frontend user groups.


## Configuration

In order to customize the MFA overlay, you should include the static template
"Protect MFA" to your TypoScript template, define custom location for the
template and override it to suit your needs.
